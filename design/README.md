### Why is this in Rust, and not a sane language like C# or Python?

The short answer is that I can't stand most of those languages, and I'd rather
have fun using a "hipster" language (not that Rust is some strange, unknown
language that nobody uses -- it ranked first on the StackOverflow "most loved"
programming language for [https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages](four years in a row))
than grind away at some other, more well-known language.

In general, I think that functional languages (or, at least, languages with
mainstream functional features, like sum types, pattern matching, etc) are far
better for things like compilers and assemblers, where representing the data is
as much of a problem as manipulating it.
